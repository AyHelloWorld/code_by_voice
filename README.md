This setup is highly customized to my liking, and very much a work
in progress. The general steps
to replicate this setup would be:

    0. Buy Dragon NaturallySpeaking 13
    1. Install Natlink
    2. Install Dragonfly
    3. Set Natlink user directory to this repo
    4. Install Cygwin with openssh, rsync, and screen
