I took lots of inspiration from both [shippy/vim-grammar](https://github.com/shippy/vim-grammar) and [davitenio/dragonfly-macros](https://github.com/davitenio/dragonfly-macros)

This setup is highly customized to my liking, and very much a work
in progress. The general steps
to replicate this setup would be:

    0. Buy Dragon NaturallySpeaking 13
    1. Install Natlink
    2. Install Dragonfly
    3. Set Natlink user directory to this repo
